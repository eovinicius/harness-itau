# Bootstrap a New Project from the Template

Two jobs: **(1)** rename the template to the user's name, and **(2)** strip the sample **Todos** feature (keep Users + auth — most apps need them). Confirm the new name with the user first.

## 1. Rename

The template ships as the `CleanArchitecture` solution with a `Api` app and `Domain`/`Application`/`Infrastructure`/`SharedKernel` projects.

- Rename `CleanArchitecture.slnx` → `{Name}.slnx`.
- If the user wants a namespace prefix (e.g. `Acme.Billing.Domain`), rename each project folder + `.csproj` + its root namespace + every `using`, and the `<ProjectReference>`/`InternalsVisibleTo` entries. If they're fine with the plain layer names (`Domain`, `Application`, …), skip this.
- Replace the template's hardcoded identifiers: `Jwt:Issuer`/`Audience` and the downstream base addresses in `appsettings*.json`, the service names in `docker-compose.yml`, the `README.md` title, and any `UserSecretsId` if they want a fresh one.

## 2. Remove the Todos sample

Delete the Todos slice everywhere:

- `app/src/Domain/Todos/`, `app/src/Application/Todos/`, `app/src/Infrastructure/Todos/`, `app/src/Api/Controllers/TodosController.cs`
- `app/tests/Application.UnitTests/Todos/`, `app/tests/IntegrationTests/Todos/`
- Delete `ITodoItemRepository` and remove its `AddHttpClient<ITodoItemRepository, TodoItemRepository>` registration from `app/src/Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs` (and its base address from `appsettings*.json`).

## 3. Re-point the harness

Rules, skills and agents use the Todos slices as **canonical models** (e.g. `Todos/Complete/`, `Todos/GetById/`, `TodosController`). After step 2 they point at files that no longer exist.

- Run `bash scripts/agents/verify-harness.sh`: the "caminhos citados" check lists every broken reference with the file that cites it.
- For each one, point to the equivalent model that still exists (usually in `Users/`) — edit only the file that owns the convention (`.claude/rules/harness.md`). If there is no equivalent (e.g. the ownership model `Todos/GetById/`), drop the "model:" pointer, keep the rule text, and tell the user; don't invent a new model.
- If the solution was renamed, replace `CleanArchitecture.slnx` in `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/` and `scripts/agents/` (`grep -rn "CleanArchitecture.slnx"`) — `stop-verify.sh` builds it by name.
- Finish with `verify-harness.sh` at exit 0.

## Rules

- Keep the whole SharedKernel/Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Api structure and every cross-cutting concern (auth, controllers, rate limiting, security headers, observability) — only the *sample feature* is removed.
- Build + `dotnet test` after each stage; the integration tests surface any dangling reference.
- Leave the `.claude/skills/` pack in place so the conventions travel with the new project.
